# Unit Tests for Helm Charts

The following directory defines unit tests for charts, using the following plugin:

https://github.com/lrills/helm-unittest

The `.values` directory here is useful for placing in values files for alternative/manual testing/validation using `helm template ...`

[Writing standard helm chart tests](https://github.com/helm/helm/blob/master/docs/chart_tests.md) in `templates/` is also encouraged
